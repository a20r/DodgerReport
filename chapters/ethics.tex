\chapter{Ethics}

\label{chapter:ethics}

Since this project does not use any personal or classified information and the
algorithms developed have not been tested with humans as obstacles, this
project does not raise any ethical concerns. One could argue that the
algorithms developed could be used in the robot uprising, but that is not the
intention of the work and the robot uprising is not set to come for another few
decades. A possible vessel for this uprising is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:skynet}~\cite{skynet}.
