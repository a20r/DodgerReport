    In the domain of mobile robotics, the ability for a robot to navigate
    safely through an uncertain dynamic environment is a core component of
    autonomy.  In many situations, the motion of dynamic obstacles is
    predictable. This information can be used by a planner to generate safe,
    collision free paths to the goal. This paper develops a novel probabilistic
    representation of dynamic obstacles using their predicted trajectories that
    can account for an obstacle diverging from its prescribed path. This
    representation is used to add time dependent costs on the edges of a
    probabilistic roadmap (PRM). A graph search algorithm is presented that can
    find safe paths through the PRM to guide a robot from its initial
    configuration to a goal configuration amidst stochastic dynamic obstacles.
    The developed planning approach is shown to outperform a potential fields
    planner for guiding a robot in multiple situations and for different
    notions safety.
