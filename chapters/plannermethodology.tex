\chapter{Planner Methodology}

\label{chapter:plannermethodology}

As with any research project, many different attempts were made to come up with
a solution to the objectives state in Ch.~\ref{chapter:objectives}. Three
different techniques were developed in sequence to try and provide a solution
that best matched the sought behaviour for the planner. The first attempt was a
simple potential field that would take into account the predicted trajectories
of the obstacles, and leverage this information to provide safer paths. The
second attempt included generating a probabilistic roadmap in relative
space-time and using stock graph search algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm
and Edmond's algorithm to derive low costs paths through the environment. The
last attempt, and the most successful is a planner that uses a two dimensional
probabilistic roadmap to sample the search space and then uses Best First
Search to expand nodes in space-time to determine the minimum cost path through
the dynamic environment. These three attempts are described individually and
more detail in this section.
