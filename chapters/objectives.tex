\begin{equation}
    J(C) = \int\limits_C \exp{\Big(P_A(x, y, t_0, t_m) + 1\Big)} \, \mathrm{d}s
    \label{eq:obj}
\end{equation}

Where $P_A : U \subset R^4 \rightarrow R$, $C \subset U$, $s \in C$, and $g
\in C$ where $s$ and $g$ are the starting and goal configurations respectively.
The curve $C$ that minimizes $J$ will be the path in space-time that has the
smallest chance of coming into contact with an obstacle and is thus the safest
possible path through the dynamic environment.
